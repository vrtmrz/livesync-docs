# Introduction

**Abstract**
Initially, this plugin was created for the people with restricted use of the cloud. We use CouchDB for an explicit reason. We are free to say thank you and be polite to the Obsidian and Apache foundation. And thank you!
 
## A bit long, but it might be a good narrative.
 
In the beginning, this plugin was made for me, to comply with the regulations that rule traditional companies. So this plugin uses established software stacks for make easier to pass the auditing of server-instaled software source codes.
 
I have been asked to account and responsibility. But I hoped to avoid them by "Given enough eyeballs". ("the Cathedral and the Bazaar",Raymond, Eric Steven, 1999)

This trial works very well, so we will continue not using the software that we should investigate individually (This includes software that I wrote). This means we should to avoid writing any server software and using a non-common protocol if there are no escape-hatch. 

This is why we use CouchDB.

And, We appreciate authors and communities. Especially, Obsidian and CouchDB.
(I still sometimes wonder why this plugin has been admitted as a community plugin. All we can do is do our best and be grateful to them. )

Of course, you too. Thank you all. 
Contributions are always welcome.
