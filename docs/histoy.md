We can see the editing history of the document in `Show history`. (only changes that happend on the device opened `Show history`)

And content can be copied to clipboard by `Copy to clipboard`, and take file back to the content on that point by `Back to this revision`. 
If we take the document back to the old revision, it will be saved as new revision with current timestamp to override other devices. Be careful, but we can take it back again and again.

**Note** If you change the filename, the history will be lost.

If we want to show about the file that we had deleted, we can find them to `Pick a file to show history`
